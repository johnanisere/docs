## API Environments

Bullring Finance provides two distinct environments for staging and production purposes:

### ðŸ§ª Staging Environment
- Base URL: `https://staging-api.bullring.finance`
- Use this environment for integration testing, sandbox payments, and development.

> ðŸ’¡ You can simulate crypto payments using our staging wallet:  
> [https://regtestwallet.netlify.app](https://regtestwallet.netlify.app) â€” this tool mimics real transactions so you can test your integration without using real funds.

### ðŸš€ Production Environment
- Base URL: `https://api.bullring.finance`
- Use this environment when you're ready to go live with real payments.
