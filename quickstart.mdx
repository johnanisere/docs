## Start Building with Bullring Finance

Welcome to the Bullring Finance API documentation. This quickstart guide walks you through selecting the right environment and getting ready to go live.

---

### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Bullring provides two separate environments for development and production:

- ðŸ§ª **Staging Environment** â€“ use for testing and sandbox payments  
  `https://staging-api.bullring.finance`

- ðŸš€ **Production Environment** â€“ use for live merchant transactions  
  `https://api.bullring.finance`

> ðŸ’¡ To simulate crypto payments in the staging environment, use our test wallet: [regtestwallet.netlify.app](https://regtestwallet.netlify.app). This tool mimics real transaction behavior so you can test your integration end-to-end.

More info is available in the [Environment](/environment) section.
