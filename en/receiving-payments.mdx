Bullring Finance makes it simple to receive payments from anyone, anywhere. You can accept payments in various currencies, and the funds will be added to the corresponding balance in your account.

## Fiat Payments

To receive fiat payments, you can provide your customers with the appropriate bank details for the currency you want to receive. Bullring provides you with virtual bank accounts for this purpose.

For BRL deposits, you can request a deposit and get the details to share with your customer.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/deposits \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "channelId": "brl-channel-id-bullring-finance",
    "amount": 100
  }'
```

## Crypto Payments

You can also receive payments in a variety of cryptocurrencies. To get a deposit address, you can use the onchain deposit endpoint.

To get a Solana address for deposits:
```bash
curl https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/deposits/crypto/SOL-DEVNET \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

For lightning network deposits:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/deposits/lightning \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 10000,
    "currency": "usd",
    "note": "payment"
  }'
```
This will generate a lightning invoice that you can share with your customer.
