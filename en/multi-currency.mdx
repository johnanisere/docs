description: "Managing balances in multiple currencies"
---

Bullring Finance allows you to hold balances in various currencies, making it easy to manage international payments without worrying about currency conversion fees. Each account can have multiple currency "pockets," and you can seamlessly switch between them.

## Supported Currencies

We support a wide range of fiat and digital currencies. Some of the major currencies include:

-   USD (United States Dollar)
-   EUR (Euro)
-   BRL (Brazilian Real)
-   NGN (Nigerian Naira)
-   USDC (USD Coin)
-   USDT (Tether)

## Viewing Balances

You can retrieve the balances for a specific account by making a `GET` request to the `/v1/ramp/accounts/{accountId}` endpoint. The response will include a `balances` object with a breakdown of each currency.

```bash
curl https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

The response will look something like this:

```json
{
  "accountId": "YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID",
  "balances": {
    "USD": "1000.00",
    "EUR": "500.00",
    "USDC": "250.00"
  },
  "email": "customer@example.com"
}
```

## Currency Conversion

You can convert between currencies using the `/v1/banking/rate` endpoint to get the latest exchange rates.

```bash
curl "https://api.bullring.finance/v1/banking/rate?from=USD&to=EUR" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
