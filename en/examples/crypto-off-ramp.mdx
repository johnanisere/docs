## Scenario
A user wants to sell Bitcoin or USDC and receive cash in their local bank account (e.g., Brazil PIX) immediately.

## Workflow

### 1. Generate Deposit Address
- **Bitcoin:** `POST /v1/ramp/{id}/banking/deposits/lightning`
- **USDC:** `GET /v1/ramp/{id}/banking/deposits/crypto/SOL-MAINNET-BETA`

### 2. Monitor for Deposit
Wait for the deposit to be confirmed and credited to the subaccount USD balance.

### 3. Instant Withdrawal
Trigger a withdrawal to the user's pre-registered local bank account.

```javascript
// Pseudo-code
// 1. Get Deposit
const invoice = await createLightningInvoice(subId, 50); // $50 worth

// 2. Listen for completion (Polling or Webhook)
await waitForDeposit(invoice.id);

// 3. Payout to PIX
await bullring.createWithdrawal(subId, {
  account_id: userPixRecipientId,
  amount: "50", // USD equivalent to withdraw
  currency: "BRL" // Target currency
});
```
