## Overview
Securely add external bank accounts and send funds to them.

## 1. Validate Recipient Details
**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/banking/{currency}/validate`

Verify account details before adding them (e.g., Validate PIX key or NGN account number).

```javascript
// Pseudo-code
const isValid = await bullring.validateRecipient({
  currency: "NGN",
  accountNumber: "0062881117",
  bankCode: "270"
});

if (!isValid) throw Error("Invalid account details");
```

## 2. Create Recipient
**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/recipients`

Save the validated details as a recipient.

```javascript
// Pseudo-code
const recipient = await bullring.createRecipient(subaccountId, {
  currency: "NGN",
  account_number: "0062881117",
  account_owner_name: "John Doe",
  bank_code: "270",
  bank_name: "Access Bank",
  country: "NG"
});
```

## 3. Initiate Withdrawal (Payout)
**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/withdrawals`

Send funds to the created recipient.

```javascript
// Pseudo-code
const withdrawal = await bullring.createWithdrawal(subaccountId, {
  account_id: recipient.account_id, // Use the ID from the recipient creation
  amount: "5000",
  currency: "NGN"
});
```
