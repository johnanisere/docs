## Overview
Provide users with transparent quotes for deposits and withdrawals.

## 1. Get Exchange Rate
**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/banking/rate`

Fetch the current rate between two currencies (e.g., USDC to NGN).

```javascript
// Pseudo-code
const rateData = await bullring.getRate({
  from: "usdc",
  to: "ngn"
});
// rateData.rate = 1500.00
```

## 2. Calculate Fee
**Endpoint:** `GET /v1/banking/withdrawal/fee` or `GET /v1/banking/deposit/fee`

Estimate the fee for a specific amount.

```javascript
// Pseudo-code
const feeData = await bullring.getWithdrawalFee({
  currency: "ngn",
  amount: 100000
});

// Display breakdown:
// Amount: 100,000
// Fee: feeData.netAmount (or specific fee field)
// Total to Receive: feeData.grossAmount
```
