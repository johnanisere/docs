Bullring Finance simplifies international invoicing by allowing you to request payments in various currencies. While our API does not have a dedicated invoicing object, you can easily create invoice-like functionality by combining our payment request features.

## Creating a Payment Request

To "invoice" a client, you can generate a payment request. For crypto payments, this can be a Lightning invoice or a static address for a specific cryptocurrency.

### Lightning Invoice

You can generate a Lightning invoice for a specific amount. The client can then pay this invoice using any Lightning-enabled wallet.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/deposits/lightning \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 10000,
    "currency": "usd",
    "note": "Invoice #123"
  }'
```

### On-Chain Address

Alternatively, you can provide the client with a deposit address for a specific cryptocurrency.

```bash
curl https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/deposits/crypto/SOL-DEVNET \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Tracking Payments

You can track the status of incoming payments by listening to webhook events or by polling the list deposits endpoint. When a payment is received, the funds will be automatically added to the corresponding currency balance in your account.

```bash
curl https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/deposits \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
