Bullring Finance is an ideal solution for businesses that need to pay a global workforce. You can pay your employees in their local currency or in cryptocurrency, no matter where they are located.

## Paying Employees

To process payroll, you can use our "Making Payments" functionality to send funds to your employees. You'll first need to add each employee as a recipient with their bank account or crypto wallet details.

### Adding Employees as Recipients

For an employee in Brazil who wants to be paid in BRL:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/recipients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "currency": "BRL",
    "pix_key": "EMPLOYEE_PIX_KEY"
  }'
```

For a remote employee who prefers to be paid in USDC:
```bash
# This recipient is just the wallet address, so you can directly pay.
```

## Automating Payroll

You can automate your payroll process by creating a script that iterates through your list of employees and initiates payments using the Bullring API.

For example, to pay an employee in BRL:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/withdrawals \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "account_id": "EMPLOYEE_PIX_KEY",
    "amount": "5000",
    "currency": "BRL"
  }'
```

To pay an employee in USDC on the Polygon network:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/withdrawals/stablecoin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "2000",
    "stablecoin": "usdc",
    "chain": "polygon",
    "address": "EMPLOYEE_WALLET_ADDRESS"
  }'
```

By leveraging Bullring's API, you can build a robust and automated payroll system that caters to a global team.
