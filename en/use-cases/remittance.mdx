## Scenario
An exporter in Nigeria needs to receive NGN from local customers, convert it to USD to hedge against devaluation, and later pay suppliers in Europe (EUR).

## Workflow

### 1. Receive Funds (NGN)
Use the **Fiat On-Ramp** pattern.
- Endpoint: `POST /v1/ramp/{id}/banking/deposits`
- Currency: `NGN`
- Result: Subaccount balance credited in USD (auto-conversion).

### 2. Hold Funds
Funds sit safely in the subaccount in USD. No API action needed.

### 3. Pay Supplier (EUR)
Use the **Beneficiaries & Payouts** pattern.
- Create Recipient (EUR): `POST /v1/ramp/{id}/banking/recipients`
  - Bank details: IBAN, SWIFT/BIC.
- Withdraw: `POST /v1/ramp/{id}/banking/withdrawals`
  - Currency: `EUR`
  - Source: USD balance is converted to EUR at the time of withdrawal.

```javascript
// Pseudo-code Summary
await depositNGN(subaccount, amount);
// ... time passes ...
const recipient = await createEURRecipient(subaccount, ibanDetails);
await withdrawEUR(subaccount, recipient.id, invoiceAmount);
```
