## Overview

You can withdraw funds from a subaccount's USD balance in two ways:
1.  **Fiat Payouts:** Convert USD to local currency (e.g., NGN, BRL, EUR) and send it to a bank account.
2.  **Stablecoin Off-ramp:** Withdraw USD as stablecoins (USDC/USDT) to an external crypto wallet.

This guide covers validating recipients, creating beneficiaries, and initiating withdrawals.

## 1. Validate Recipient Details (Fiat)

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/banking/{currency}/validate`

Before adding a recipient for fiat withdrawals, it is **crucial** to validate the account details. This ensures the account exists and prevents failed transactions or lost funds.

<Note>
  Always validate account numbers and bank codes before attempting to create a recipient.
</Note>

### Example: Validate NGN Account

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.bullring.finance/v1/banking/ngn/validate" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "accountNumber": "0062881117",
    "bankCode": "270"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "accountNumber": "0062881117",
  "bankCode": "270"
}
```

## 2. Create Recipient

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/recipients`

Once validated, save the details as a recipient. This recipient `id` will be used to initiate withdrawals.

### Example: Create NGN Recipient

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/<SUBACCOUNT_ID>/banking/recipients" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "currency": "NGN",
    "account_number": "0062881117",
    "account_owner_name": "John Doe",
    "bank_code": "270",
    "bank_name": "Access Bank",
    "country": "NG"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "f4725e12-466f-49fd-89bd-899635f3f7f6",
  "bank_name": "Access Bank",
  "account_owner_name": "John Doe",
  "last_4": "1117",
  "active": true,
  "account_id": "0062881117",
  "currency": "NGN"
}
```

## 3. Initiate Fiat Payout

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/withdrawals`

Send funds from the subaccount's USD balance to the created recipient. The system will automatically convert the USD amount to the recipient's local currency.

### Example: Withdraw to NGN Recipient

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/<SUBACCOUNT_ID>/banking/withdrawals" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "account_id": "0062881117",
    "amount": "50",
    "currency": "NGN"
  }'
```

> **Note:** The `amount` field specifies the amount in the **destination currency** (e.g., NGN). The equivalent USD will be deducted from the subaccount.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "856b896f-3f16-4f70-952d-ce1f65b28aaa",
  "amount": "50",
  "currency": "NGN",
  "status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2025-11-21T15:59:09.341Z",
  "protocol": "wire",
  "fee_amount": "0.50",
  "fee_currency": "USD",
  "rate": 1500.00
}
```

## 4. Stablecoin Off-ramp (Crypto Withdrawal)

**Endpoint:** `POST /v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/withdrawals/stablecoin`

You can also withdraw the USD balance directly as stablecoins (USDC or USDT) to an external wallet address.

### Example: Withdraw USDT on Ethereum

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/<SUBACCOUNT_ID>/banking/withdrawals/stablecoin" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "100",
    "stablecoin": "usdt",
    "chain": "ethereum",
    "address": "0x22ccb74a200d7b8094b72482edd46e23cbf3af37"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "acbad679-7fcf-44a5-be65-dfa27a824113",
  "amount": "100.00",
  "currency": "USD",
  "status": "pending",
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "local_currency": "usdt",
  "destinationAddress": "0x22ccb74a200d7b8094b72482edd46e23cbf3af37",
  "tx_hash": null
}
```

## Common Mistakes

1.  **Skipping Validation:** Failing to validate bank account details often leads to failed withdrawals and unnecessary delays.
2.  **Incorrect Network:** When withdrawing stablecoins, ensure the `chain` matches the destination wallet (e.g., sending ERC-20 USDT to a TRC-20 address will result in loss of funds).
3.  **Insufficient Balance:** Ensure the subaccount has enough USD balance to cover the withdrawal amount **plus fees**.
4.  **Unverified KYC:** Withdrawals are only permitted for subaccounts with approved KYC.

## Webhook Events

Listen to webhook events to track the status of your withdrawals in real-time.

-   `withdrawal.status.completed`: The funds have successfully reached the destination.
-   `withdrawal.status.failed`: The withdrawal could not be processed.

See [Withdrawal Events](/en/withdrawal-events) for payload details.
