## Scenario
A user wants to sell Bitcoin (via Lightning Network) and receive cash in their local bank account (e.g., Brazil PIX) immediately using a single streamlined flow.

## Workflow

### 1. Add Beneficiary Bank Account

First, add the destination bank account as a beneficiary. This is where the funds will be sent after the crypto is received.

<Note>
  See the [Add Beneficiary](/api-reference/beneficiaries/add-beneficiary) API reference for full details.
</Note>

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/beneficiaries \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --data '{
  "account_id": "667.136.083-96",
  "account_type": "cpf",
  "currency": "BRL"
}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "343bb162-d0ae-46ef-a5bb-13505eb52c89",
  "account_id": "667.136.083-96",
  "account_type": "cpf",
  "currency": "BRL",
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "2025-11-25T12:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### 2. Initiate Crypto Offramp

Initiate the offramp by specifying the recipient (beneficiary ID) and the amount in the destination currency. The API will generate a Lightning invoice that the user needs to pay.

<Note>
  See the [Offramp Crypto](/api-reference/withdrawals/offramp-crypto) API reference for full details.
</Note>

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/offramp/initiate \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --data '{
  "recipient_id": "343bb162-d0ae-46ef-a5bb-13505eb52c89",
  "amount": 88
}'
```

**Response:**

```json

}
```

**Key Response Fields:**
- `lightningInvoice` - The Lightning invoice that the user needs to pay
- `lightningAmount` - The amount of satoshis to pay
- `targetAmountReceivable` - The amount the user will receive (after fees)
- `totalFees` - Total fees charged for the transaction

### 3. User Pays Lightning Invoice

The user pays the Lightning invoice using their Bitcoin Lightning wallet. Once the invoice is paid, Bullring automatically processes the withdrawal to the beneficiary's bank account.

### 4. Check Offramp Status

You can check the status of the offramp transaction at any time using the offramp ID.

<Note>
  See the [Get Offramp Status](/api-reference/withdrawals/get-offramp-status) API reference for full details.
</Note>

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/offramp/{offrampId}/status \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

**Response:**

```json

  "success": true,

    "withdrawalFee": 0.11,

  }
}
```

**Status Values:**

- `processing` - Invoice paid, withdrawal being processed
- `completed` - Funds successfully sent to beneficiary
- `failed` - Transaction failed (see `errorMessage` for details)

## Advantages

This streamlined offramp flow offers several benefits:

- **Single API Call**: Generate the Lightning invoice and initiate the withdrawal in one request
- **Automatic Processing**: Once the Lightning invoice is paid, the withdrawal is automatically processed
- **Real-time Exchange Rates**: Get the current exchange rate and fees upfront
- **Simple Integration**: No need to manage separate deposit and withdrawal flows
