## Scenario
A global company holds funds in USDC/USD and needs to pay contractors in Brazil (BRL), Nigeria (NGN), and Kenya (KES) simultaneously.

## Workflow

### 1. Fund Main Account
Use the **Crypto Treasury** pattern. The company (Main Account) deposits funds into their subaccount to build a balance.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -X GET "https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/deposits/crypto/ETH-MAINNET" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```
</CodeGroup>

[See API Reference](/api-reference/deposits/onchain-deposit)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "f156b4cb-9b34-4c45-bed1-92576c703412",
  "address": "0x34e36e819b37577c66e7032e060866bd6a04e677",
  "chain": "ETH-MAINNET",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "addressTag": null,
  "createdAt": "2025-11-21T11:17:42.575Z"
}
```

### 2. Iterate and Pay
Loop through your payroll list and trigger withdrawals.

For each employee:
1. **Create Recipient** (if they don't exist yet).
2. **Withdraw** funds from the Main Account to the Recipient.

```javascript
// Pseudo-code
const employees = [
  { id: "user_brazil", currency: "BRL", amount: 5000, pix: "user@example.com" },
  { id: "user_nigeria", currency: "NGN", amount: 300000, account: "1234567890" },
];

const MAIN_ACCOUNT_ID = "YOUR_TREASURY_SUBACCOUNT_ID";

for (const emp of employees) {
  // 1. Create Recipient
  // call POST /v1/ramp/{MAIN_ACCOUNT_ID}/banking/recipients
  
  // 2. Withdraw
  // call POST /v1/ramp/{MAIN_ACCOUNT_ID}/banking/withdrawals
}
```

#### Step 2a: Create Recipient

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -X POST "https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/recipients" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "currency": "BRL",
    "pix_key": "user@example.com"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

[See API Reference](/api-reference/recipients/add-fiat-recipient)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "recipient_123",
  "currency": "BRL",
  "pix_key": "user@example.com",
  "created_at": "2025-11-21T11:20:00.000Z"
}
```

#### Step 2b: Withdraw

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -X POST "https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/withdrawals" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "account_id": "recipient_123",
    "amount": "5000",
    "currency": "BRL"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

[See API Reference](/api-reference/withdrawals/withdraw-fiat)

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "856b896f-3f16-4f70-952d-ce1f65b28aaa",
  "amount": "5000",
  "currency": "BRL",
  "status": "pending",
  "created_at": "2025-11-21T15:59:09.341Z",
  "protocol": "pix",
  "local_currency": "BRL",
  "local_amount": 5000,
  "fee_amount": "0.50",
  "fee_currency": "USD"
}
```

### 3. Track Status
Poll the withdrawal status or listen for webhooks.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -X GET "https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/withdrawals/856b896f-3f16-4f70-952d-ce1f65b28aaa" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
```
