## Overview

Bullring allows you to collect funds from users (Collections) and send funds to users (Payouts) using both Fiat and Crypto rails. This guide demonstrates how to implement these flows.

## Collections (Deposits)

Collections allow you to receive funds into your subaccount. You can collect funds via local banking rails (Fiat) or blockchain networks (Crypto).

### Fiat Collections

To collect fiat currency, you request a deposit instruction. The response will provide the necessary details for the user to make the transfer (e.g., a PIX code for BRL, or bank account details for USD).

<Note>
  See the [Request Fiat Deposit](/api-reference/deposits/request-fiat-deposit) API reference for full details.
</Note>

#### Example: Collecting BRL via PIX

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/deposits \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --data '{
  "channelId": "brl-channel-id-bullring-finance",
  "amount": 100
}'
```

The response will contain the PIX code or payment instructions.

### Crypto Collections

To collect crypto, you generate a deposit address for a specific blockchain network. Any funds sent to this address will be credited to your subaccount.

<Note>
  See the [Onchain Deposit](/api-reference/deposits/onchain-deposit) API reference for full details.
</Note>

#### Example: Generating an ETH Address

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/deposits/crypto/ETH-MAINNET \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "id": "f156b4cb-9b34-4c45-bed1-92576c703412",
  "address": "0x34e36e819b37577c66e7032e060866bd6a04e677",
  "chain": "ETH-MAINNET",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "addressTag": null,
  "createdAt": "2025-11-21T11:17:42.575Z"
}
```

## Payouts (Withdrawals)

Payouts allow you to send funds from your subaccount to external bank accounts or crypto wallets.

### Fiat Payouts

To send fiat currency, you first need to create a recipient (beneficiary) and then initiate a withdrawal to that recipient.

1.  **Create Recipient**: Use the `/recipients` endpoint (see [Beneficiaries](/use-cases/beneficiaries) guide).
2.  **Initiate Withdrawal**: Send funds to the recipient.

<Note>
  See the [Withdraw Fiat](/api-reference/withdrawals/withdraw-fiat) API reference for full details.
</Note>

#### Example: Sending BRL Payout

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/withdrawals \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --data '{
  "recipient_id": "f556899a-eea7-4a18-b9e8-6346823a9b06",
  "amount": "500",
  "currency": "BRL"
}'
```

### Crypto Payouts

To send stablecoins (USDC, USDT) to an external wallet, specify the amount, token, chain, and destination address.

<Note>
  See the [Withdraw Stablecoin](/api-reference/withdrawals/withdraw-stablecoin) API reference for full details.
</Note>

#### Example: Sending USDT on Ethereum

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/{subaccountId}/banking/withdrawals/stablecoin \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --data '{
  "amount": "100",
  "stablecoin": "usdt",
  "chain": "ethereum",
  "address": "0x22ccb74a200d7b8094b72482edd46e23cbf3af37"
}'
```
