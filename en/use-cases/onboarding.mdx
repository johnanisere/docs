## Overview

This guide covers the complete flow for onboarding a new user (subaccount), including creation and KYC/KYB verification.

To onboard a new user, you must create a subaccount. This is the first step before they can deposit funds or perform any banking operations.

### Request

To create a subaccount, send a `POST` request to `/v1/ramp/subaccount` with the user's email address.

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/subaccount \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "email": "customer@example.com"
  }'
```

### Response

The API will return the newly created subaccount's details, including its unique `id`.

```json
{
  "id": "6a0fd7af-181d-4c0f-b24b-b8cfb739dabc",
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "status": "created"
}
```

### Webhooks

When a subaccount is created, you will receive a `subaccount.status.created` event.

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "6a0fd7af-181d-4c0f-b24b-b8cfb739dabc",
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "status": "created"
  },
  "event": "subaccount.status.created"
}
```

## Retrieving a Subaccount

You can check the balance and status of a subaccount at any time.

### Request

```bash
curl https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/subaccount/SUBACCOUNT_ID \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Response

The response includes the current balance and verification status.

```json
{
  "id": "6a0fd7af-181d-4c0f-b24b-b8cfb739d67a",
  "email": "customer@example.com",
  "balance": "100.00000000",
  "balanceCurrency": "USD",
  "status": "approved",
  "createdAt": "2025-11-19T23:59:29.241Z"
}
```

## Listing Subaccounts

To view all your users, you can retrieve a paginated list of subaccounts.

### Request

```bash
curl "https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/subaccounts?page=1" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Next Steps & Features

Once a subaccount is created, you can access the full suite of Bullring's financial features for that user. Most of these operations require the subaccount to complete [Verification](/api-reference/verification).

### 1. Verification (KYC/KYB)

Before a subaccount can transact, they must verify their identity. There are 2 levels of KYC separated by country:

- **Tier 1**: Grants access to all currencies except **USD** and **EUR**. This level is required to unlock **NGN** transactions.
- **Tier 2**: Grants access to all currencies except **NGN**. This level is required to unlock **USD** and **EUR** transactions.
- [See Verification API](/api-reference/verification)

### 2. Deposits (On-Ramp)

Subaccounts can fund their balances using various methods:

- **Fiat**: Local bank transfers, Mobile Money (e.g., NGN, GHS, ZMW).
- **Crypto**: On-chain transfers (ETH, SOL) or Lightning Network (BTC).
- [See Deposits API](/api-reference/deposits/request-fiat-deposit)

### 3. Withdrawals (Off-Ramp)

Subaccounts can withdraw their funds to:

- **Fiat Recipients**: Wire transfers (USD, EUR), PIX (BRL), Mobile Money.
- **Crypto Wallets**: Stablecoins (USDC, USDT) or Bitcoin.
- [See Withdrawals API](/api-reference/withdrawals/withdraw-fiat)

### 4. Recipient Management

Save beneficiary details (bank accounts, crypto addresses) to make repeated withdrawals easier and safer.

- [See Recipients API](/api-reference/recipients/get-all-recipients)

### 5. Rates & Fees

Check real-time conversion rates and calculate fees before initiating transactions to ensure transparency for your users.
