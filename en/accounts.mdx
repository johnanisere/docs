description: "Understanding the relationship between Accounts and Subaccounts"
---

In Bullring Finance, the structure is designed to separate the integration partner (you) from your end-users (customers).

- **Account**: Represents your organization or business. This is the top-level entity that holds API keys and integrates with Bullring.
- **Subaccount**: Represents an individual user or customer within your application.

Each **Subaccount** is completely isolated from others. They have their own:
- **Balances**: Funds held in one subaccount are not accessible by others.
- **Verification Status**: Each subaccount must undergo its own KYC/KYB verification.
- **Transaction History**: Deposits and withdrawals are linked specifically to a subaccount.
