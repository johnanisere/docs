With Bullring Finance, you can easily send payments to bank accounts, crypto wallets, and other Bullring accounts. This guide provides an overview of the payment process and how to use our API to initiate transactions.

## Adding a Recipient

Before you can send a payment, you need to add a recipient. A recipient can be a bank account, a crypto address, or another Bullring account.

To add a BRL recipient via Pix:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/recipients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "currency": "BRL",
    "pix_key": "71719844194"
  }'
```

To add an NGN recipient:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/recipients \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "account_number": "0062881117",
    "bank_code": "270",
    "currency": "NGN"
  }'
```

## Sending a Payment

Once you have added a recipient, you can initiate a payment using the `/v1/ramp/{accountId}/banking/withdrawals` endpoint.

To send a BRL payment:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/withdrawals \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "account_id": "71719844194",
    "amount": "10",
    "currency": "BRL"
  }'
```

To send a stablecoin payment:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.bullring.finance/v1/ramp/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/banking/withdrawals/stablecoin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "12",
    "stablecoin": "usdt",
    "chain": "ethereum",
    "address": "0x22ccb74a200d7b8094b72482edd46e23cbf3af37"
  }'
```
