## Creating a Payment for a New Merchant (Subaccount)

This guide outlines the steps to start accepting crypto payments for a new merchant using Bullring Finance.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: You can start creating payment requests **immediately after merchant registration**. However, the merchant must complete verification and register a Pix key before any withdrawal can occur. See the [Withdrawal Flow](/withdrawal) for details.

### Step 1: Register a New Merchant

Send a request to the [`Create Subaccount`](/api-reference/subaccount/create-merchant) endpoint to register the merchant by their email.

```http
POST /v1/ramp/subaccount
```

**Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "merchant@example.com"
}
```

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "47a79c3d-9a2b-4998-898b-8eb7fad01526",
  "email": "merchant@example.com"
}
```

### Step 2: Create a Payment Request

Once the merchant is registered, you can immediately begin generating invoices by calling the [`Create Payment`](/api-reference/payments/create-payment) endpoint.

```http
POST /v1/ramp/subaccount/{id}/payments
```

**Body:**
```json
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "currency": "brl",
  "note": "Milk x 5"
}
```

This returns a Lightning invoice your customer can use to complete the payment.
