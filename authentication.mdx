title: Authentication
---

To access Bullring Finance APIs, you must authenticate every request using an API key. This key ensures your application is verified and authorized to interact with the platform.

---

## Get Your API Key

1. Log in to the Bullring Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Developers → API Keys**
3. Click **Generate Key** for either **sandbox** or **production**
4. Copy and store your key securely — it won’t be shown again

Each environment has its own unique key. Use the **sandbox key** for testing and the **production key** for live transactions.

---

## Authentication Header

All requests to both environments **must** include your API key in the following header:

```http
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

If your request does not include a valid key, it will be rejected with a `401 Unauthorized` response.

## Best Practices

- 🔒 Never expose your API key in frontend code
- 🔁 Rotate your API keys periodically for added security
- 👀 Monitor usage in the Bullring Dashboard
