## Webhook Events

Webhooks allow your system to automatically receive real-time updates from Bullring Finance when specific events occur. You can register a webhook URL to listen for event notifications and trigger your own workflows.

Bullring Finance can notify your server in real time about changes to subaccount status, payment confirmations, and withdrawal progress.

To start receiving webhooks, register your endpoint via your Dashboard or the [Webhook API](/api-reference/webhook/add-webhook).

---
## How It Works

When an event occurs, Bullring Finance sends an HTTP `POST` request to your registered URL with a JSON payload describing the event. Your endpoint must return a `2xx` status code to acknowledge receipt.

All webhook requests are signed using a shared secret. You should verify the request signature before processing.

### Subaccount Events

- `subaccount.status.created`
- `subaccount.status.approved`
- `subaccount.status.declined`
- `subaccount.status.review`

These events are triggered when a new store (subaccount) is created or goes through KYB review stages.

---

### Payment Events

- `payment.status.paid`
- `payment.status.unpaid`

These events notify you when an invoice is paid or expires without being paid.

---

### Withdrawal Events

- `withdrawal.status.not_initiated`
- `withdrawal.status.in_progress`
- `withdrawal.status.completed`
- `withdrawal.status.failed`

These events allow you to track the status of your storeâ€™s fiat payouts.

### Webhook Payload Format

Each webhook will be sent as a POST request to your registered endpoint with the following structure:

```json
{
  "event": "event.name",
  "data": {
    "...": "event-specific payload"
  }
}
```
