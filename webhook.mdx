title: Webhooks
---

Webhooks allow your system to automatically receive real-time updates from Bullring Finance when specific events occur. You can register a webhook URL to listen for event notifications and trigger your own workflows.

---

## How It Works

When an event occurs, Bullring Finance sends an HTTP `POST` request to your registered URL with a JSON payload describing the event. Your endpoint must return a `2xx` status code to acknowledge receipt.

All webhook requests are signed using a shared secret. You should verify the request signature before processing.

---

## Registering a Webhook

To register a webhook, use the following endpoint:

```http
POST /api/v1/ramp/subaccount/webhook
```

### Sample Payload
```json
{
  "url": "https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/payment"
}
```

You can manage, update, or remove webhooks via the API.
